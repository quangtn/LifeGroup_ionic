##Groups (Private/Public)

When a new group is created it is by default private.

* The User who creates the group is the owner of the group. 
* It is his private group which he manages. 
* He is the administrator of the group.
* Users can request to join a group of which they know of
* The administrator has the right to decline without reason.
* When declined a user will receive declined and cannot belong to that group
* The administrator of the group can send join requests to members via email. 
* Once the members accept they will be able to receive prayer requests send out by that groups leader.
* The administrator can assign anyone in the group to also be administrator
* When an administrator deiced to leave the group and if there is no other administrator the current administrator must try and assign other users as admins, with their consent.
* He cannot just leave since someone need to be the owner of the group, and it can only be one of the administrators.
* With email consent the other users can accept to be the owner of the group, the new owner immediately becomes the admin of that group
* The administrator can change the group status from private to public when he should which to do so.
* The administrator decides on the group type. The group type is assign when the group is created. See group Types below
Any users can plan an event or meeting or prayer request, but it has to be accepted by anyone one of the administrator of the group, before the event is sent out ot everyone of that group
NOTE * Most screens below are a list at the top and then they can add at the bottom, when they click in the list object it load the bottom or another screen which contains the details with add, edit, delete.

Visibility is Private or Public, Private will always be the default especially for new groups and is only visible within the same group, outside world cannot see the group exists. Public groups are when a group is public so only the group name is visible to the world. But the admin of that public group still needs to give consent when a user requests permission to join, or when an invitation has been sent to this user for joining a particular group. 

a Group must always have at least one or more admin user types. If an admin decides to leave the group and if they are the only admin user they need to first assign another user the ability to become admin. Once the other user gave connect or confirmed that they will be admin they need to fill in the user registration in full and then they will become admin. Once they are admin the other admin user can leave the group.


Communication to and from Groups

* Emails can be send to everyone in the group
* If possible for the first release text message notification can also be sent to group members
* Events can be planned for groups. On each event emails will be sent to group
* For every event there should be a venue address
Each person can setup any amount of venues.
